# RobotariumSwarmBots
This set of MATLAB code consists of scripts made to run in the Georgia Tech Robotarium (https://www.robotarium.gatech.edu/) environment. It controls swarms of robots moving around their environment as they swarm around moving point targets.  

This code will not run outside the Robotarium or its simulator's environment. The supporting code may be found here: https://github.com/robotarium/robotarium-matlab-simulator.
